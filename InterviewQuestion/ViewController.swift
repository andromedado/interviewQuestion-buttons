/**
 
 Within the tilesContainerView, create a grid of 16 (4x4) equally sized buttons.
 
 Each button should have an "on" and "off" state, signified by a background color.
 
 Tapping a button should toggle its state, AND its immediate neighbors' states.
 
 When the randomize button is tapped, the states of all of the buttons should be randomized.
