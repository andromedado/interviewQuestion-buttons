# Interview Question - Buttons Grid

- Within the tilesContainerView, create a grid of 9 (3x3) equally sized buttons.
 
- Each button should have an "on" and "off" state, signified by a background color.
 
- Tapping a button should toggle its state, AND its immediate neighbors' states. (non-diagonal immediate neighbors)
 
- When the randomize button is tapped, the states of all of the buttons should be randomized.
